## Today

Today is a day of much shiny-ness!

## Labs

If you haven't made it to the first class functions material...just skip ahead and make sure you are get a few labs from the first class functions material as well as some stuff from the OO labs.

Today, Make sure you get the event listeners lab and the jQuery Selectors lab complete.

## Anything Else?

Remember, if you finish early...please Slack me (@joe) Moving forward onto React or something like that isn't your best option. Spend this time preparing for technical interviews. We will give you some CS material and also interview challenges.
