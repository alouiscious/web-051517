## Today

Today you'll have some time to review, do some practice. Were there any labs you didn't feel solid on? Maybe try and add a new feature to them. For example, if you are struggling with API stuff, maybe convert your Github lab to fetch instead of `$.ajax`. Concerned about some OO JS material? Grab an older lab in the jQuery sections and refactor it out to OO JS. Want to keep working on your project? do that!

In addition to working on labs, we have another whiteboarding session today. It will be run the exact same as last time. We do these in class, instead of as "homework" because there is added pressure to having a strict time limit, not knowing the problem in advance and ultimately being _required_ to do it. These problems are hard!

Demos are ON for this afternoon.
