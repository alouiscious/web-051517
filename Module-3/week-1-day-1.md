## Topics

 * JS Basics
 * JS Arrays
 * JS Objects

## Labs

The goal is to complete all labs through the Data Structures unit. This should look *very* similar to Ruby!

## Anything Else?

If you have already done all the labs through bootcamp prep, I want you to focus on starting to practice your *interview style* questions in JS. My favorite site for this is CoderWars. Here are two great collections. Start with number 1, then move on to number 2.

 1. https://www.codewars.com/collections/javascript-academy
 2. https://www.codewars.com/collections/interview-prep-a

If you ever feel like you don't have anything to do. Complete as many of those as you can. The more practice you get the better!
