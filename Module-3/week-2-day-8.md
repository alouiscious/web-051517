## Topics

 * Rails API Backends

## Today

Too long have we been relying on someone elses API. Today we take the magical land of APIs back into our own hands and build a simple API with Rails so that our jQuery front end can read from it. First I want to make sure you understand how the basic `to_json` works, and then the final form of JSON output with Active Model Serializers. 

## Labs

Stop doing other labs, and make it through the `to_json` labs at least. This should give you enough context to be successful in lecture in the afternoon. If you finish through there and are still feeling a lot of energy towards your project feel free to keep working on that.
