## Topics

 * JS First Class Functions
 * JS Callbacks
 * Map/Reduce/Filter

## Today

This will be some of the first material that is different than Ruby. Our goal here is to understand how functions can be stored as data and generally how to use Callbacks. Callbacks are a fundamental part of JS and your understanding of them is crucial. You will hear a lot of talk about Closures as well whenever Callbacks gets brought up. This is important academically...bought not practically. We'll cover it more during the end of Week 2. If you are feeling adventurous (and down to get
confused) take a look at the reading below.

## Labs

The goal is to get through the map and the reduce lab. If you finish that, you'll get practice with map and reduce lab.
