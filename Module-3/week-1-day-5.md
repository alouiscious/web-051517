## Today

Today we will be doing something a bit new. Technical Interview practice. At 9:45 we will pair everyone up. Each pair should have a coder and an interviewer. The coder should open up google docs to a blank doc. at 9:45 we'll distribute over slack the first warmup challenge and start the clock for 10 minutes. Coders should start working on it. Verbalize what you are doing, make sure the interviewer understands what you are doing. You may only use the JS MDN documentation. After 10 minutes, we'll give
you a few min for feedback and then SWITCH. There should be a new coder. We'll give another 10 minute warmup challenge over slack. Then a few minutes for feedback and we'll give another "work" problem. This time 25 minutes on the clock. Afterwards a few minutes for feedback and then SWITCH. New coder, new "work" problem, 25 minutes on the clock. If whoever is coding finishes early we also have a stretch problem for you. 

The goal here is to mimic what happens in _many_ coding interviews. They are either done on a whiteboard or remotely via google docs. It's really odd working without your text editor auto complete. It's really odd working with someone staring at your code, and it's really odd working without the entirety of your labs or the internet to help solve problems. Finally, it's _really hard_ to code and *speak* about what you are coding. The only way to get better at this is to practice...so
that's what we are doing.

## Labs

Make sure you get jQuery event listeners complete and get started on Async. You probably won't get much headway today.

## Anything Else?

Remember, if you finish early...please Slack me (@joe) Moving forward onto React or something like that isn't your best option. Spend this time preparing for technical interviews. We will give you some CS material and also interview challenges.
